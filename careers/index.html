            <h3>Business Development Specialist</h3>
            <p>Zinn Labs is a venture-backed, pre-launch startup on a mission to redefine the role of eyewear in our lives. Spun out of the Stanford Computational Imaging lab, we have developed breakthrough technologies enabling next-generation smart eyewear to offer new interactions, diagnostics, and experiences without sacrificing style.

As an early business hire you will be expected to wear a number of hats and be quick to learn. You will work closely with the executive and technical teams to develop strategy and launch new programs and products.

                <li>Motivate the team, track performance, and report metrics</li>
                <li>Contribute to the development of an all-day, every-day eye-sensing platform</li>
            </ul>

            <p>What we look for:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>5+ years of relevant work experience in a business development position</li>
                <li>Experience working at an early stage startup</li>
