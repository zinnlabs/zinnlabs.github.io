            <h3>Electronics Engineer</h3>
            <p>Zinn Labs is a venture-backed, pre-launch startup on a mission to redefine the role of eyewear in our lives. Spun out of the Stanford Computational Imaging lab, we have developed breakthrough technologies enabling next-generation smart eyewear to offer new interactions, diagnostics, and experiences without sacrificing style. In a <a href="https://www.ted.com/talks/nitish_padmanaban_autofocusing_reading_glasses_of_the_future">TED talk</a> by one of our co-founders, you can learn how our technology can be applied to effectively restore natural vision for anyone over the age of 50.</p>

            <p>Zinn Labs is seeking employee #1, an electronics engineer that enjoys prototyping low-power embedded systems and iterating quickly to scale effectively. You will build solutions in a fast-paced and collaborative environment focusing on both low-level software/firmware design and circuit design. You will have an integral role in technical decisions that define our product and influence the customer experience. You will join a collaborative but highly autonomous working environment in which each member has a defined role with clear expectations, as well as the opportunity to pursue projects they find interesting and impactful.</p>

            <p>What you&rsquo;ll do:
                <ul>
                    <li>Rapidly prototype entire embedded system electronics</li>
                    <li>Define and implement product system architecture</li>
                    <li>Design, layout, and test printed circuit boards</li>
                    <li>Bring up firmware</li>
                    <li>Develop and deploy optimized low-level software</li>
                    <li>Contribute to the development of an all-day, every-day eye-sensing platform</li>
                </ul>
            </p>

            <p>What we look for:
                <ul>
                    <li>5+ years of relevant work experience</li>
                    <li>Experience bringing up embedded systems for low-power, mobile applications</li>
                    <li>PCB CAD experience</li>
                    <li>Embedded system software development experience</li>
                    <li>Experience developing embedded systems firmware for imaging is a plus</li>
                    <li>Experience with FPGA embedded systems and other hardware accelerators is a plus</li>
                </ul>
